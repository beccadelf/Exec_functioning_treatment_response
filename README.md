# Executive Functioning in Spider Phobia: Analysis Repository

This repository contains all scripts and resources for the analyses described in the paper "Executive functioning does not predict exposure therapy outcomes and is not impaired in spider phobia."

The repository is structured into three main sections: **Model Release**, **Group Comparison** and **Machine Learning**, with the latter two aligned with the study's analytical objectives. The primary purpose of this repository is twofold:

1. To document our exact calculations and analyses, allowing other researchers to retrace our work, rather than re-run our analyses, as our data cannot be shared.
2. To enable further exploration by releasing a pretrained prediction model based on clinical and sociodemographic variables, which can be applied to independent datasets to estimate treatment response.

Researchers are encouraged to integrate our provided code into their own analyses, which may be particularly relevant for our adaptation of the SSRTcalc function (see "Function_adaptive_SSRT.R"), which implements the replacement of go-trials. For a concise summary of the analysis steps and their results, please refer to the accompanying HTML file for each script.

## Folder Structure

### 1. Model Release
This section contains a pre-trained model for treatment response prediction, along with associated model components and supporting material. It is based on a random forest classifier and was trained without oversampling, feature exclusion, or feature selection, to ensure that the full input feature set remains unchanged. In a cross-validation with 100 iterations, the model achieved an average balanced accuracy of 0.60 (SD = 0.11), with a permutation-based p-value of *p* â‰ˆ 0.08. Detailed usage instructions can be found in the 1_Model_Release folder.


### 2. Group Comparison: Executive Functions
This section contains scripts and resources for comparing executive functioning performance between participants with spider phobia and healthy controls as well as responders and nonresponders.
- **Group Comparison_Healthy Control Patients.rmd**: Compares executive functioning between patients having spider phobia and healthy controls.
- **Group Comparison_Healthy Control Patients_ANCOVA.rmd**: Controls the comparison of executive functioning between patients having spider phobia and healthy controls for confounders.
- **Group Comparison_Response Nonresponse.rmd**: Compares executive functioning between responders and nonresponders.
- **Group Comparison_Pre Post.rmd (only exploratory)**: Compares executive functioning between pre- and post-treatment.




### 3. Machine Learning: Response Prediction
This section contains scripts for building and testing machine learning models to predict treatment response based on baseline executive functions and clinical variables.

- **ML_preprocessing.Rmd**: Preprocesses the data for the subsequent machine learning pipeline.

- **Classifier_treatment_response.py**: Runs a classification machine learning pipeline.
  
- **Regressor_treatment_outcome.py**: Runs a regressor machine learning pipeline.

- **Run_scripts_sequentially.py**: Runs python / machine learning scripts at once.


### Others:
- **Function_adaptive_SSRT.Rmd**: Adapts the function "Integration_adaptiveSSD" from the SSRT-calc package (https://github.com/agleontyev/SSRTcalc/tree/master) to replace omissions errors with go-trials.

- **Useful_function.R**: Stores several useful functions used in our R-scripts.

- **Run_scripts_sequentially.py**: Reruns most of our R-scripted analyses sequentially. Ensures that most of our analysis can be reproduced at once.
